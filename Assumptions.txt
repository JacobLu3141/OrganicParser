This organic parser only applies to grade 12 level IUPAC organic compound names.
The following list of assumptions and simplifications is not exhaustive.

Functional group priority (suffix-based):
Carboxylic acids (-oic acid)
Esters (-oate)
Amides (-amide)
Aldehydes (-al)
Ketones (-one)
Alcohols (-ol)
Amines (-amine)

Supported prefixes:
Halogens: fluoro-, chloro-, bromo-, iodo-
Alcohol: hydroxy-
Amine: amino-
Ether: alkoxy- (methoxy-, ethoxy-, etc.)
Nitro: nitro-
Alkyl: methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, etc.
Hydrocarbon substituents: enyl-, ynyl-

Amines/Amides: only simple hydrocarbons or hydrogens attached to N atoms.

Ethers: only simple hydrocarbons or hydrogens on -oxy side.

Third column groups (see link below):
Cyclo hydrocarbon cannot be main chain.
Only one principal group; all other instances are substituents.

Isopropyls, isobutyls, sec-butyls, tert-butyls: only on N atoms of amines/amides.

Secondary/tertiary: not considered in alcohols, alkyl halides, or nitro groups.

Carbonyls: aldehydes (-al) and ketones (-one) as suffix; do not use oxo-.

Hydrocarbon chains: 
Assumed to be the most simplified compound.
Maximum length of 10 carbons.

Aromatics: simple benzene derivatives; no fused rings.

Simplifications: 
Ignore stereochemistry, isotopes, uncommon functional groups.
Only basic cis- and trans- isomers; no E/Z or R/S naming.

Nomenclature: 
Locants of alcohol, amine, and ketone groups must be right before the suffix.

Potential hydrocarbon naming errors (easily fixable by hand):
Longest chain not considered for main chain.
Duplicated substituent names (e.g. 1-methyl-2-methyl- instead of 1,2-dimethyl-); only for ketones.
